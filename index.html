                <p>This project will cover my journey as a Developer. Before we begin, A short introduction about myself. I am an Indian based in Germany for the past five years. I come with 10 years of functional experience in various domains. I have been working
                    for a company called Applause. It specializes in Crowdtesting solution. The clientele comprises of leading players in every vertical.
                    <br />
                    <br /> I am currently working as a Sales Team Lead. At Applause, I learned so much about technologies and methodoligies such as SDLC, product management, scrum, agile, CI/CD and product development - the company required me to become subject
                    matter expert in this domain to equip the BDRs with the technical knowledge. Therefore, I became a certified Scrum Master and Tester (ISTQB) to get a deeper understanding of challenges in the domain. This enlightening journey enlightened
                    sparked my interest in purusing a career in coding that I always wanted to and but didn't . I eventually decided to put everthing on the line and decided to dedicate my time and my energy to become the next front-end developer. I almost gave up but got back up again. Grateful for not giving up.
