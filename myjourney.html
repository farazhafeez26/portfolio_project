        <h1 style=" text-align:center;"><i><u>This is my first coding project. </i> </u> </h1>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">This project will cover my journey as a Developer. Before we begin, A short
            introduction about
            myself. I am an Indian based in
            Germany for the past five years. I come with 10 years of functional experience in various domains.
            I have been working for a company called Applause. It specializes in Crowdtesting solution. The clientele
            comprises of leading players in every vertical.
            <br />
            <br />


            I am currently working as a Sales Team Lead. At Applause, during my tenure as a BDR I learned so much about
            technologies and methodoligies such as SDLC, product management, scrum, agile, CI/CD and product
            development. I took a course in intermediate python. I got certified as a
            certified Scrum Master and Tester (ISTQB). I eventually decided that I wanted to pursue my career in Product
            Development to become the next front-end developer
